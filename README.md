# hospitals around
 Since the massive and rapid spread of COVID-19 outbreak, all countries are pursuing the
possible methods for decreasing infection rates by minimizing people's exposure. Concurrently
to these efforts, our project is providing two services, COVID-19 checker and ordinary symptom
checker.
If the COVID-19 option is chosen, a questionnaire concerning the symptoms they are
experiencing is provided. According to this questionnaire, users are categorized into mild or
severe. For mild patients, an online video examination is held between a doctor, and
accordingly, the doctor determines necessary procedures and medications after examining
patient's symptoms closely in the video meeting. Otherwise, considered severe, If the patient
falls under the severe category, the patient will be provided with the available nearby COVID-19
specialized hospitals to immediately go to and a map API will assist him/her by providing the
necessary route to the health care facility.
If the user chooses the ordinary symptom checker, the user will be redirected to another page
that contains medical categories each presenting a group of body parts/part, such as bone or
nose and ears. After choosing the category, a questionnaire is provided to be fill. If the patient is
identified as mild, an online video examination is held between the doctor for precise diagnosis.
If identified as severe, he will be provided with the vacant hospitals nearby with it's working
hours and available specializations and costs.
The application has some distinctive features, medications scheduled reminders prescribed
from the doctor, status checker checking the patients' status, and healing process.
